3. Click **"Process File"**
4. Wait for processing to complete

### Step 3: View Results
- **Total Records**: Number of records processed
- **Severity Breakdown**: Count of Slight, Serious, and Fatal predictions
- **Confidence Scores**: Individual prediction confidence levels
- **Download Results**: Get full results in JSON format

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### ‚úÖ Do's:
- Use exact column headers (case-sensitive)
- Use only the valid values listed above
- Save file as UTF-8 encoding
- Include all 14 required columns
- Use commas as separators

### ‚ùå Don'ts:
- Don't add extra spaces in column names
- Don't use values not listed in the valid values
- Don't skip required columns
- Don't use different file encodings
- Don't add extra commas or quotes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No valid records found"**
   - Check column headers match exactly
   - Verify all values are from the valid lists above

2. **"Invalid data format"**
   - Ensure speed_limit is a number (10, 20, 30, etc.)
   - Check all string values match exactly

3. **"Missing required fields"**
   - Make sure all 14 columns are present
   - Check for typos in column names

4. **"File too large"**
   - Reduce file size to under 10MB
   - Split large files into smaller batches

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Use the sample CSV provided in the application
2. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
3. Ensure the backend is running on port 8000
4. Try with a small test file first (5-10 records)

## üìä Expected Results Format

After successful processing, you'll receive:
```json
{
  "message": "Batch prediction completed successfully",
  "total_records": 6,
  "results": [
    {
      "severity": "Slight",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "risk_level": "Low",
      "model_agreement": true
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "slight": 4,
    "serious": 1,
    "fatal": 1
  }
}
