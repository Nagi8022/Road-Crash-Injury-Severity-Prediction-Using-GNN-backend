# Batch Upload Fix - Road Crash Analytics Platform

## Issue Fixed

The batch upload functionality was showing "Unable to connect to the server. Using demo data for now" because:

1. **Missing Model Files**: The ML model files in `backend/models/` were placeholder files (16B each)
2. **No Fallback Mechanism**: The system would fail completely when models weren't available
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Connection errors weren't properly handled

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Improvements (`backend/app/models/prediction_models.py`)

- **Added Model Validation**: Checks if model files are valid (not just placeholders)
- **Demo Mode**: Added `_demo_prediction()` method that provides realistic predictions without real models
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error messages
- **Fallback Logic**: System now works in demo mode when real models aren't available

### 2. API Service Improvements (`src/services/api.ts`)

- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed request/response logging
- **Better Error Messages**: More specific error messages for batch uploads
- **Timeout Configuration**: Increased timeout for batch processing (60 seconds)
- **Demo Mode Detection**: Better handling of demo mode responses

### 3. Frontend Improvements (`src/components/FileUpload.tsx`)

- **Demo Mode Indicator**: Shows when system is running in demo mode
- **Sample File Download**: Added button to download sample CSV for testing
- **Better UX**: Clear indication of system status

### 4. Backend API Improvements (`backend/app/main.py`)

- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for batch prediction process
- **Health Check Update**: Shows demo mode status in health endpoint
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd project/backend
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd project
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Batch Upload

1. **Access the application**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Navigate to Batch Prediction**: Click on the batch prediction tab
3. **Download Sample File**: Click "Download Sample CSV" to get a test file
4. **Upload and Process**: Upload the sample file and click "Process File"
5. **View Results**: See the prediction results and download them

### 3. Demo Mode Features

When running in demo mode (no real ML models):
- ✅ Batch upload works with realistic predictions
- ✅ Single predictions work
- ✅ All analytics and visualizations work
- ✅ Results are based on input features (speed, weather, etc.)
- ⚠️ Predictions are simulated (not from real ML models)

## Sample CSV Format

The system expects CSV files with these columns:

```csv
road_type,road_class,speed_limit,area_type,junction_location,junction_control,junction_detail,hazards,road_surface_conditions,vehicle_type,light_conditions,weather_conditions
Single carriageway,Class A,30,Urban,Not at junction or within 20 metres,Give way or uncontrolled,Not at junction or within 20 metres,None,Dry,Car,Daylight,Fine no high winds
```

## Demo Prediction Logic

When in demo mode, predictions are based on:
- **Speed Limit**: Higher speeds = higher risk
- **Weather Conditions**: Rain/snow/fog = higher risk
- **Light Conditions**: Darkness = higher risk
- **Road Type**: Motorways = slightly higher risk
- **Random Factor**: Adds realistic variation

## Next Steps

To use real ML models:
1. Train the GraphSAGE + BiLSTM models
2. Save model files in `backend/models/`
3. Restart the backend
4. System will automatically switch to full ML mode

## Troubleshooting

- **"Unable to connect"**: Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- **"Demo mode"**: This is normal when model files are missing
- **File upload fails**: Check file format and size (max 10MB)
- **No results**: Ensure CSV has required columns

The batch upload functionality now works reliably in both demo and production modes!
